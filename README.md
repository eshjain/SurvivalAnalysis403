# SurvivalAnalysis403
This is a project I did involving survival analysis to see if color affected the time to finish a matching game. 

Game found here: http://kuiper.pearsoncmg.com/shapesplosion/

One style of the game involved all of the different shapes and their outlines all being one color: blue. 
This style can be found by following the link and playing with the "Shape, all same color" option under matching scheme.

The other style of the game was that each shape and its outline to be matched with were both one color, 
with each shape/outline pair being its own color.
This style can be found by following the link and playing with the "Both shape and color" option under matching scheme.

We analyzed the times to completion for these two data sets using surivival analysis, KM curves, and hazard plots.

We were able to conclude that color did in fact have an effect on time taken to complete this matching game.

The .csv file is the data set in which we had 30 people play one style of the game and 30 different people play the other style of the game.

The .r file is the code I wrote for the statistical analysis conducted.

The .pdf file was our groups paper on our experiment and the conclusions we were able to draw from it.
